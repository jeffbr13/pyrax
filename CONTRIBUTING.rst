Please submit an issue before submitting a pull request so we can determine
whether or not the change may be accepted. Pyrax is in the process of being
deprecated in favor of the OpenStack SDK. We will announce the process and
timelines for this deprecation as soon as we can.

Once a pull request has been deemed the right approach, please be sure that
*all* pull requests are made against the **working** branch of the project,
as we reserve the **master** branch for full releases.

For style guidelines, please see the `HACKING <HACKING.rst>`_ document in the
root of this repository.

If you find any bugs, or have ideas for improving pyrax, please create an issue
at:

Thanks!
